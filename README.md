# Aortic-Stenosis-Project
This repository contains the files used for the research that investigates the inequality existed in treatment allocation for AS patients in Quebec. 

All the files can be categorized into 3 folders: 
1. Data cleaning and data pre-processing. This section includes data extraction details, the process of matching codes in health care records to their actual meaning, converting address to distance and descriptive analysis for all the available information.
2. Model construction and model simulations. I compared the performance of shrinkage priors and the performance of spatial models with simulated dataset. 
3. Final data analysis: data is analyzed with the best model selected through 2, and posterior results are summarized. 

Note: Due to confidentiality, the data sets used in this project are private. I simulate a simple data set if anyone wants to test the model.
